Release Schedule
================

Rope has a release schedule once a month, usually sometime close to the 15th of
each month. However, this schedule is not a guaranteed date, if there is a
particularly urgent change or if there's not enough pull requests for the
month, there may be additional releases or the release window may be skipped.
